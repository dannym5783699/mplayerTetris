--Project Description:
- This game is Tetris. The goal is to make full rows out of the falling shapes to clear the lines.
- You must also avoid reaching the top, or you lose.
- Once a line is filled up it is cleared, moving lines above down.
- Random shapes appear at the top that you can rotate and move left, right or down.
- Once a shape hits the bottom of the board or is on top of another block you cannot move it.
- Only falling blocks can be moved.
- One line clear on level one is worth 200 points and is doubled for each extra line clear in one turn.
- An extra 100 points is added each level to line clears.
- A shape falls down one row every 980ms at level one and -20 per each level after.

--Issues:
- The Blocks go slightly off the grid to the right but this is just graphical.
